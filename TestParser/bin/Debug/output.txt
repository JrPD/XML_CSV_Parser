XML has been widely adopted as a way to format data in many contexts. For example, you can find XML on the Web, in configuration files, in Microsoft Office Word files, and in databases.

It provides the in-memory document modification capabilities of the Document Object Model (DOM), and supports LINQ query expressions. Although these query expressions are syntactically different from XPath, they provide similar functionality.
